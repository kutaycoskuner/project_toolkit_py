FACULTY OF ARCHITECTURE  
LASER CUTTER MANUAL  
 
Our Faculty has a Universal PLS6.150D and a VLS 6.60 laser cutter. Before using the laser cutter, all 
users should read the guide carefully and make reservation for the laser cutter at least two days in 
advance. During the peak times of the semester, the reservations should be made at least a week in 
advance.  
 
1. File setups  
The laser cutter machine cuts and etches only vector data. You can use different programs such as 
AUTOCAD, CORELDRAW, ILLUSTRATOR, and RHI NO ETC. as long as  your files are saved in DXF 
format.  
 
In order to prepare your drawings for laser cutter, you will need to organize your drawings.  
 
1.1. The drawings should be adjusted to the siz e of the laser cutter’s bed (810x 450  mm).  
A very simple way to adjust your drawing is to draw a box as a template on model space and to 
place the drawing into this box (template) to ensure that your drawing is not truncated.  
 
 
 
In order to minimize the wasted material, all the pieces should be arranged in the most e fficient 
configuration. Additionally, by labeling each piece, you can make easier to construct your model. 
Please use only iso.txt  as text style for your part labels.  
 
 Please don’t forget to remove duplicate lines. Commands for removing duplicate lines are  
overkill (Autocad) and Seldup (Rhino).   
1.2. The drawings should be scaled to the actual size of the model (1 unit=1 mm).  
 
1.3. The laser cutter does not recognize layers, but colors. Your drawing should be organized by 
colors.  
 Red (RGB: 255,0,0) for cutting  
 Blue (RGB: 0,0,255) for drawing  
 Black (RGB: 0,0,0) for etching  
 
1.4. The laser cutter does not recognize pen weights,  
 
In AUTOCAD and RHINO, The line weights should be default  
In CORELDRAW, the line weights should be hairline.  
 
1.5. The files should be correctly labeled  in the following way.  
Course code_Name_job number  
Arch402_AyseKorkmaz_5  
 
1.6. Please submit your files by email to foamorl @ metu.edu.tr  or bring them on a CD, flash 
memories will not be allowed.
